                <p>
                    Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we
                    may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is
                    absolutely necessary to maintain the website. Information
                    collected automatically is used only to identify potential
                    cases of abuse and establish statistical information
                    regarding website usage. This statistical information is not
                    otherwise aggregated in such a way that it would identify
                    any particular user of the system. <br /> <br /> You can
                    visit the website without telling us who you are or
                    revealing any information, by which someone could identify
                    you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you
                    wish to use some of the website’s features, or you wish to
                    receive our newsletter or provide other details by filling a
                    form, you may provide personal data to us, such as your
                    email, first name, last name, city of residence,
                    organization, telephone number. You can choose not to
                    provide us with your personal data, but then you may not be
                    able to take advantage of some of the website’s features.
                    For example, you won’t be able to receive our Newsletter or
                    contact us directly from the website. Users who are
                    uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to
